# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
The task for this project is to create a Deep Learning model for text classification. Particularly, the goal is to identify disaster tweets, which are real-time emergency tweets posted by users on Tweeter.

I will create multiple RNN models in this project, iterating over various architectures, and tuning the hyperparameters.
